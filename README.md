## What I Find Intresting about this Article:
ChatGPT has revolutionized so many aspects of everyday life. Before ChatGPT, people knew AI existed, but in my experience, AI wasn't available in an easily digestible way. ChatGPT, on the other hand, is simple and easy to use, which allows people to understand how useful AI can be. I am beyond excited about Codex and the level of innovation it will promote. 

Regarding Codex, I am interested in who owns the code it produces. When a software developer writes code, that code is typically the property of the developer or the company that the developer works for (depending on contracts). However, there is a point of ambiguity regarding the code Codex produces. I am excited to see the legal ruling as to who has the right to answers made by Codex.
